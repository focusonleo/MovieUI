    <string name="simple_text">From the crowning of Ado as its first Oba, Lagos (then called Eko) served as a major center for slave-trade, from which then Oba of Benin Ado and all of his successors for over four centuries supported - until 1841, when Oba Akitoye ascended to the throne of Lagos and attempted to ban slave-trading. Until today, the Oba of Lagos is the head of all the Kings in Lagos State and his status is different from other Obas most of whom were later given back their crowns and staff of office only within the last 40 years.
